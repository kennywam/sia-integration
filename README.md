# Sia Integration Project

## Overview

The **Sia Integration Project** is a guided journey that blends **learning** and **hands-on implementation** to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant for a multi-tenant SaaS platform.  
Over five themed modules you will move from AI theory to a production-ready, permission-aware assistant capable of answering contextual questions against live business data.

This project is designed for engineers, architects, and AI enthusiasts who want to understand not just the "how" but also the "why" behind building scalable, secure, and production-grade AI assistants. The approach is practical, modular, and focused on real-world SaaS requirements.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Support:** Serve multiple organizations with strict data isolation and tenant-aware context.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions for users, admins, and service accounts.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Combine LLMs with vector search for accurate, context-rich answers.
- **Document Ingestion Pipeline:** Seamlessly process and embed PDFs and other business documents.
- **Streaming Chat UI:** Real-time, responsive chat experience with context switching.
- **Observability:** Built-in metrics, tracing, and error tracking for reliability and debugging.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Ready for cloud-native deployment with CI/CD, Docker, and Vercel.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Swap out tools and models as needed; designed for easy customization.
- **Security Best Practices:** Rate limiting, tenant isolation, and secure API endpoints.
- **Monitoring & KPIs:** Track usage, performance, and success criteria with dashboards and analytics.

## Core Objectives

1. **Master RAG fundamentals** – retrieval workflows, embeddings, prompt design, and context injection.
2. **Integrate AI at scale** – wire up frontend, backend, and vector storage to serve multiple tenants safely.
3. **Ensure security & governance** – enforce role-based permissions, rate limiting, and tenant isolation.
4. **Optimize & observe** – add caching, monitoring, and KPIs to guarantee reliability and measurable impact.

## Learning Journey

| Week  | Theme                                                       | Key Deliverables                                            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Fundamentals** – RAG, embeddings, prompt engineering      | POC chatbot that answers from a small document set          |
| **2** | **Architecture & Multi-Tenancy**                            | System diagrams, permission matrix, data-ingestion pipeline |
| **3** | **Backend Services** – RAG query API, context manager       | NestJS modules, LangChain chains, caching layer             |
| **4** | **Frontend Integration** – chat component, context provider | React hooks, streaming UI, integration tests                |
| **5** | **Deployment & Observability** – security, KPIs             | Vercel deployment, dashboards, success-criteria report      |

Each week’s folder inside `sia-integration-plan/` contains:

- **Concept notes** – concise theory with links to deeper resources
- **Hands-on guides** – code snippets, command-line steps, and checklists
- **Reflection questions** – prompts to consolidate learning and plan next tasks

## Expected Outcomes

By the project’s end you will have:

- **A working AI assistant** that cites sources, respects tenant boundaries, and enforces RBAC.
- **A reusable NestJS + Next.js blueprint** for future AI-augmented features.
- **Practical experience** with vector databases, LangChain, and Vercel AI SDK.
- **Operational playbooks** for monitoring, performance tuning, and success measurement.
- **A reference implementation** that can be adapted for other SaaS or enterprise AI projects.
