# Fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. This document provides an overview of the foundational concepts of RAG, including its architecture and key components.

## Key Components
1. **Retrieval Mechanism**: This component retrieves relevant documents or data from a database or knowledge base.
2. **Generative Model**: This model generates responses based on the retrieved information, often using techniques from natural language processing (NLP).
3. **Integration**: The seamless integration of retrieval and generation processes is crucial for effective RAG systems.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture of a RAG system typically includes:
- A data source (e.g., vector database)
- A retrieval engine
- A generative model (e.g., transformer-based model)
- An interface for user interaction

### week-1/vector-databases.md
# Vector Databases in AI Applications

## Introduction
Vector databases play a critical role in AI applications, particularly in RAG systems. They are designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional data efficiently.

## How Vector Databases Work
- **Storage**: Data is stored as vectors, which represent features of the data points.
- **Retrieval**: Vector databases use similarity search algorithms to quickly find relevant vectors based on a query vector.

## Benefits
1. **Efficiency**: Fast retrieval times for high-dimensional data.
2. **Scalability**: Capable of handling large datasets.
3. **Flexibility**: Supports various data types and structures.
